## 🔍 File Descriptions

### ✅ `word_count_program.py`
- Takes a string and counts the **frequency of each word**.
- Uses `dict.get()` for safe updates.

### ✅ `frequency_counter_character_counter.py`
- Counts the **frequency of each character** in a string.
- Demonstrates `dict` for letter analysis.

### ✅ `nested_dictionaray.py`
- Stores student records in a **nested dictionary**.
- Each student has `name`, `age`, and `grade`.
- Iterates over nested data cleanly.

### ✅ `test.py`
- Scratchpad file for testing or extra logic.
- Can be deleted or used as sandbox.
